# Pollution_Analysis
This is a beginner-level Data Science project carried out in the MCA I Semester, as a Data Visualizatin Project.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

How can comprehensive pollution analysis across Indian states and global cities, coupled with real-time monitoring through live dashboards, be utilized to formulate tailored tree-planting strategies per capita as a solution to reduce pollution and bolster environmental health?

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Increasing pollution levels pose a significant threat to the environment and human health in various states across India and cities worldwide.

The lack of comprehensive analysis and actionable insights regarding pollution hotspots, coupled with diminishing forest cover, exacerbates this issue. Our project aims to address this by conducting in-depth pollution analysis, leveraging data-driven methodologies to create live dashboards, and proposing targeted tree planting strategies per capita to mitigate pollution and enhance environmental sustainability.


This project works on 3 datasets; Cities.xlsx, State.xlsx, and TreesDatset.csv

The project is divided into 3 parts working on each of the three datasets:

Part-1: Analysing pollution in Indian states to know nations' pollution situation-- States.xlsx

Part-2: Analysing pollution in cities across the globe to know the global situation on pollution.-- Cities.xlsx

Part-3: Analysing forests in India to get to know possible ways to reduce pollution by planting more trees. -- TreeDataset.csv


DATA SOURCE:

-- The three datasets are provided in the file named Dataset.zip.

-- This repository also contains the project report and PowerPoint presentation in a file named Other.zip.

-- The PowerBi dashboard file is Visualizaton Project.pbit.

-- Link for web sources is given in the last, references, section of the report.
